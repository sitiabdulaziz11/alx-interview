we already set the first box as visited by visited_box[box_number] = True, right? isn't it enough? is visited_box[box_number] = True and dfs(0) deffrent?


ChatGPT
You're correct. Setting visited[0] = True before calling dfs(0) is indeed sufficient to mark the first box as visited. The call dfs(0) is indeed different from setting visited[0] = True, but it serves a purpose beyond just marking the first box.

Let me clarify the difference:

visited[0] = True:
This line specifically marks the first box as visited before the DFS traversal begins.
It ensures that we don't revisit the first box during the traversal.
dfs(0):
This call initiates the depth-first search (DFS) traversal from the first box (boxes[0]).
It triggers the recursive exploration of all reachable boxes from the first box.
During the traversal, as boxes are visited, their corresponding entries in the visited list are updated to True to keep track of which boxes have been visited.
dfs(0) ensures that we start exploring from the first box and continue visiting other boxes recursively.
While setting visited[0] = True is necessary to mark the starting point, calling dfs(0) is essential to initiate the DFS traversal process, which involves recursively visiting all reachable boxes starting from the first box. Both are necessary for the algorithm to function correctly.
