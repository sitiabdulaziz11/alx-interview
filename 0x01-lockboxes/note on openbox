In Python, lists are indexed starting from 0. So, when we say "the index of the outer list corresponds to the box number", it means that the index of each inner list within the outer list represents the number of the box.

Let me illustrate this with an example:

Consider the following boxes list:

python
Copy code
boxes = [[1], [2, 3], [0], []]
The first inner list boxes[0] represents box number 0.
The second inner list boxes[1] represents box number 1.
The third inner list boxes[2] represents box number 2.
And so on.
So, in this example:

boxes[0] contains the keys to box 1.
boxes[1] contains the keys to boxes 2 and 3.
boxes[2] contains the key to box 0.
boxes[3] is an empty list, meaning box 3 doesn't have any keys.
Understanding this indexing scheme is crucial for navigating through the boxes and their corresponding keys when implementing the canUnlockAll() function. We use the index of the outer list to refer to the box numbers while iterating through the boxes list.


boxes[0] contains the keys to box 1:
In the boxes list, boxes[0] refers to the first inner list.
In this case, boxes[0] is [1].
This means that box number 0 (boxes[0]) contains a key with the number 1.
So, the key inside boxes[0] opens box number 1.
boxes[1] contains the keys to boxes 2 and 3:
boxes[1] refers to the second inner list.
In this case, boxes[1] is [2, 3].
This means that box number 1 (boxes[1]) contains keys with the numbers 2 and 3.
So, the keys inside boxes[1] open boxes number 2 and 3.
boxes[2] contains the key to box 0:
boxes[2] refers to the third inner list.
In this case, boxes[2] is [0].
This means that box number 2 (boxes[2]) contains a key with the number 0.
So, the key inside boxes[2] opens box number 0.
boxes[3] is an empty list, meaning box 3 doesn't have any keys:
boxes[3] refers to the fourth inner list.
In this case, boxes[3] is [], an empty list.
This means that box number 3 (boxes[3]) doesn't contain any keys. It's empty.
So, in summary, each inner list (boxes[i]) contains the keys that can be used to open the corresponding box with the number i. And an empty list signifies that the box doesn't have any keys.



In the example provided, the outer list is boxes, and its indices correspond to the box numbers. Let's go through the example and identify them:


boxes = [[1], [2, 3], [0], []]
Index 0 of boxes (boxes[0]) corresponds to box number 0.
Index 1 of boxes (boxes[1]) corresponds to box number 1.
Index 2 of boxes (boxes[2]) corresponds to box number 2.
Index 3 of boxes (boxes[3]) corresponds to box number 3.
So, in this example:

boxes[0] represents the keys for box number 0.
boxes[1] represents the keys for box number 1.
boxes[2] represents the keys for box number 2.
boxes[3] represents the keys for box number 3.
This is what we mean when we say "the index of the outer list corresponds to the box number". Each index of the boxes list corresponds to a specific box, and the content at that index represents the keys for that box.
