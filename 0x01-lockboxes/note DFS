We start from the first box (boxes[0]) and explore all the boxes reachable from it using the keys. how to visit the box ? in depth-first search we complete all subtrees before moving to the next , right? how it done help me

Yes, you're correct about the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. In DFS, we explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Let's break down how we can apply DFS to visit the boxes reachable from the first box (boxes[0]).

Here's how we can do it:

Start with the first box (boxes[0]):
Begin by visiting the first box, boxes[0], as it's already unlocked.
Explore the keys in the current box:
Look at the keys inside boxes[0]. These keys indicate which other boxes can be opened from the current box.
For each key, visit the corresponding box:
For each key in boxes[0], if the key corresponds to a valid box number (i.e., within the range of 0 to n-1) and the box it opens hasn't been visited yet, visit that box.
Repeat the process recursively for each newly visited box:
Once you visit a new box, repeat steps 2 and 3 for that box. This is where DFS comes into play. We go as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Mark each visited box:
As you visit each box, mark it as visited to avoid visiting it again and to keep track of which boxes have been explored.
Continue until all reachable boxes are visited:
Repeat steps 2 to 5 until all reachable boxes have been visited. If at any point we find a box that cannot be visited, we stop the process.
This approach ensures that we explore all reachable boxes from the first box using DFS. By the end of the process, if all boxes have been visited, then we can conclude that all boxes can be opened.
